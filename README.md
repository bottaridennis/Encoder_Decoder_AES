KEY GENERATION

The file named genKey.py is used on terminal to generate a key, use it if you don't have any (REMEMBER THE KEY, IF YOU LOOSE IT YOU WILL NEVER HAVE YOUR FILE BACK)

Command: { python genKey.py }

USE FROM TERMINAL

The file named main_termial.py is used to run the Python program on terminal, it has it's own interactions and guide (REMEMBER THE KEY, IF YOU LOOSE IT YOU WILL NEVER HAVE YOUR FILE BACK) 
you can decide if you want to over-write your file or if you want to create a new one,
when it asks {Enter the path of the file to encrypt: } you have to write the path to the file starting from the same folder as the main_terminal.py file
when it asks {Enter the path of the file to save: } you can write the same path as the previous step, but then you will have to keep your key if you want to decrypt the file
you can write the path and name of a non-existing file to create a new one where the file will be copied and encripted.

Command: { python main_terminal.py }

USE THE PROGRAM

The file main.py will start a window with 2 paths forms and 1 key form, with the program you cannot generate a key, but you can use the same one for all of your files

Command { python main.py }

in this project I used the following libraries:
Tkinker
AES
